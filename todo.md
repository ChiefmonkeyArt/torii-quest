## Working Rules

- **Every fix should improve the foundation when useful**: add or strengthen an SDK/API seam, debug hook, smoke check, or code index entry.
- **No big rewrites**: every task must leave one system cleaner, more testable, or more agent-readable than it found it. Incremental slices only; broad speculative rewrites create bug cycles and waste handoff context.
- **SDK evolves from working code**: extract boundaries around systems we touch and prove, not speculative framework layers.
- **Agent/dev efficiency matters**: keep `CODE_INDEX.md`, `ENGINE.md`, `window.ToriiDebug`, regression checks, and handoff reports current enough that future agents can find faults quickly.
- **Agent handoff design**: maintain a clear engine/game split, public APIs per system, `CODE_INDEX.md`, debug snapshots via `ToriiDebug`, tests for every extracted seam, explicit constraints in comments/docs, source-of-truth doc references, and small focused modules. A new agent or developer should be able to locate any fault using repo docs and tests alone, without reading every source file.
- **Cross-agent portability**: structure the repo so another AI or developer can pick up work using docs and tests. DeepSeek, perplexica, routstr, and other operators are plausible future contributors; we do not guarantee any specific agent, but we design so handoff is possible without source archaeology.
- **Rapier is the physical truth layer**: combat, LOS, bot bullets, crates, boundaries, and future interactable objects should converge on reusable Rapier-backed APIs.
- **Cut dead structure**: remove duplicate, stale, or completed structural tasks unless they directly support new features on solid foundations.
- **Prefer FOSS and open protocols**: do not design toward Google, Cloudflare, Microsoft, or Babylon.js dependencies.

## Near-Term — Agent-Readable Structure

These tasks build the structural layer that makes the project legible to any agent, contributor, or auditor without source archaeology. Work through them in order; each one enables the next. The goal is not abstraction for its own sake — it is making the codebase handoff-safe so FOSS contributors, future AI operators, and the project itself are not locked into any single session's context.

| # | Category | Task |
|---|----------|------|
| ARS-1 | DEBUG | **Debug dump / handoff snapshot** — extend `window.ToriiDebug` to expose a `ToriiDebug.snapshot()` call that serialises the current game state (phase, player position, bot states, last hit, last shot, version) to a JSON-serialisable object. This gives any incoming agent an instant read on the runtime state without tracing globals. Document the snapshot shape in `CODE_INDEX.md`. |
| ARS-2 | PHYSICS | **Physics interaction API** — define the public surface of the Rapier physics layer: what callers can ask (`castRay`, `hasLineOfSight`, `createDynamicBody`, `createStaticBody`, `createSensor`) and what they must not reach past. Add JSDoc `@public` / `@internal` markers to `engine/physics/raycast.js` and `engine/physics/bodies.js`. Write one test that exercises the public surface with a mock world. |
| ARS-3 | PHYSICS | **Rapier raycast service** — extract a `RaycastService` facade that wraps `castRay`/`hasLineOfSight` behind a single injectable interface. Callers (bots, bullets, LOS) receive the service; they do not import Rapier directly. Reduces coupling and allows the test suite to inject a mock implementation. |
| ARS-4 | ARCH | **Player state machine cleanup** — fold `reloading` and `pointerLocked` into the guarded FSM in `src/state.js`. Add tests for the new edges. Remove any remaining direct `state.phase =` writes outside `state.js`. A single auditable player lifecycle is easier for any new agent to read without tracing scattered flags. |
| ARS-5 | SDK | **SDK/API skeleton** — add a top-level `src/sdk/index.js` that re-exports the stable public APIs from physics, combat, entities, and identity layers. This is the single import point for external contributors and future community modules. Document each export's stability tier (`stable` / `experimental` / `internal`) in `CODE_INDEX.md`. |
| ARS-6 | INDEX | **CODE_INDEX.md upkeep** — after each ARS task, update `CODE_INDEX.md` to reflect the new module boundary, public API, debug hook, test file, and any known constraints or open edges. The index is the primary agent-handoff document; it must stay current or it becomes misleading. |
| ARS-7 | ARCH | **Handoff template** — write a `HANDOFF.md` template (or add a `## Handoff` section to `CODE_INDEX.md`) that any agent or developer fills in at the end of a session: version changed, what was tested, open edges, next recommended task, and constraints discovered. Makes the next session's context window useful immediately, regardless of which AI or developer picks up. |
| PROGRESS-1 | DOCS | **Formalise / maintain `progress.md`** — keep track bars, sprint table, and completed-last-24h current. After each sprint or significant landing, move crossed-out completed items from `todo.md` into the Archive in `progress.md` and update the relevant track bar. Aim for weekly upkeep at minimum. |

## Now — Foundation Close-Out

| # | Codebase | Category | Task |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| TQ-MANUAL-113 | TQ | TESTING | **Manual smoke test v0.2.113-alpha** — on real hardware verify head/body classification, reticle states (orange close, green body, green + 👌 headshot), crate bullet nudges, reload clunk-click speed, look-down POV, mirror, reflected gun, NAP NPC, footsteps, bot LOS, and general combat feel. |
| IDX-1 | TQ | INDEX | **Create/maintain dev index** — add a lightweight `CODE_INDEX.md` / index section covering core modules, SDK seams, debug hooks, smoke checks, and where to inspect common faults. This becomes part of every sprint. |
| SDK-1A | TQ | SDK | **Combat targeting seam** — treat the shared hit classifier and reticle preview as the first combat API. Keep bullet outcome and HUD preview on the same source of truth. |
| RELOAD-FEEL | TQ | WEAPON | **Reload viewmodel feel — DONE (v0.2.127).** User feedback: reload should be snappier and synced to the sound ("click down, clack snap back" — quick barrel drop then snap back). The old FP viewmodel reload used a symmetric `Math.sin(progress*π)` hump (slow, peaked mid-reload, mushy). v0.2.127 replaced it with a pure `reloadDip(p)` curve in `engine/weapons/reloadPose.js`: quick ease-out DROP (p<0.12) → HOLD lowered (0.12–0.68, the "clack" window) → fast SNAP-BACK through rest into a small overshoot (0.68–0.86) → SETTLE to rest (0.86–1). Same amplitudes (Y −0.22, Z −0.10, roll −0.6) and same `RELOAD_TIME=1.1` so audio sync + gameplay duration are unchanged; only the visual timing shape changed. Allocation-free scalar (no Three), so no hot-path alloc. Covered by `tests/reload-pose.test.js` (8 tests). **Manual:** verify the gun visibly clicks down fast, holds briefly, then snaps back with a tiny overshoot, in time with the clunk-clunk-click audio. |
| PHYS-1A | TQ | RAPiER | **Crate interaction tuning** — tune bullet impulse strength only after manual testing. Keep impulses behind the physics/raycast/bodies seam. |
| COMBAT-HEADZONE | TQ | COMBAT | **Head-zone height + re-entry hit-reg — FIXED (v0.2.128).** Manual feedback: (1) on first entry body hits register but headshots are "out" — the player could only score by aiming ABOVE the target; (2) on the SECOND game entry hardly any body or head shots connect. **Bug 1 root cause:** the head sphere sat too high — old `BOT_HEAD_CENTRE_Y_OFFSET` 1.65 + `BOT_HEAD_RADIUS` 0.22 spanned [1.43,1.87], but the Banker GLB crown is ≈1.70, so the sphere's top floated 0.17 m ABOVE the visible head while a crosshair on the actual face resolved the body cap (3 dmg). Fix: lower centre 1.65→1.55 (face/eye line) and tighten radius 0.22→0.20 → sphere [1.35,1.75], top hugging the crown, bottom still overlapping the body cap (1.52) so no thread-through gap. NOT loosened — the above-head zone was *removed*; lateral shoulder/above shots stay body (locked by +7 cases in `tests/classifier.test.js`). **Bug 2 root cause:** `initPhysics()` builds a BRAND-NEW Rapier world every call; the ENTER handler re-ran the full bootstrap on every entry, so bots (spawned once at load, colliders bound to the FIRST world) were orphaned in the discarded world and the live world had no bot colliders → "hardly any shots connect" on re-entry. Fix: the ENTER handler now bootstraps physics + colliders + player body + viewmodels exactly ONCE (`_arenaBootstrapped` guard); the single world persists across HOME/ENTER, and each entry only `resetRun()` + `setNextSpawn`/`resetPlayerPos` for a clean fresh run (`resetRun()` was defined in state.js but previously never called). **Manual:** put the crosshair on the bot's FACE (not above) — should one-shot; ENTER → pause → HOME → ENTER again → body and head shots must still register and `ToriiDebug.combat.lastHit` populate. |
| COMBAT-MUZZLE | TQ | WEAPON | **Muzzle/tracer origin side — FIXED (v0.2.129).** Manual feedback: bullets seem to come from the LEFT side, not the RIGHT where the visible gun is. **Root cause:** `getGunBarrelWorld` (weapons.js) built the barrel offset basis from the camera's LOCAL quaternion. But the FP camera is a CHILD of `playerObj`, which carries the YAW (the camera itself holds only pitch), so the local frame ignored yaw — the +0.12 lateral (right) offset pointed in a FIXED world direction regardless of facing, and as the player turned the bullet/tracer origin swung to the wrong (notably LEFT) side. **Fix:** extracted the barrel math to the pure `engine/weapons/muzzle.js` (`muzzlePoint`/`barrelWorldFromCamera` + `MUZZLE_FORWARD=0.30`/`MUZZLE_RIGHT=0.12`/`MUZZLE_UP=-0.10`) and rebuilt the offset basis from `camera.getWorldQuaternion()` so the +right offset tracks yaw and the muzzle stays on the visible right-hand gun. The barrel→crosshair DIRECTION (firing rule from v0.2.126) is unchanged — only the origin side was corrected. Covered by `tests/muzzle.test.js` (11 cases: +right side convention is intentional; `barrelWorldFromCamera` keeps the origin on the camera WORLD-right at every yaw — the local-quaternion regression). **Manual:** face several directions and fire — the tracer must always leave from the right-hand gun barrel, never the left; barrel→crosshair convergence unchanged. |
| COMBAT-HITREG | TQ | COMBAT | **Hit-registration — BARREL→CROSSHAIR FIX LANDED (v0.2.126); travel-time lead still open.** Manual feedback on v0.2.124: "headshots still taking two shots; body shots seem to be working". Root cause: the damage path was already correct (clean headshot 9 dmg vs `BOT_HP` 5 → one-shot; body 3 → two-shot — locked by `tests/combat-damage.test.js` via pure `engine/combat/damage.js`). The real fault was REGISTRATION parallax: the reticle previewed a headshot on the CAMERA ray, but the bullet flew the BARREL→80 m-convergence line, so muzzle parallax dropped a "headshot" onto the BODY collider (3 dmg ⇒ two shots); body shots survived because the torso is bigger. **v0.2.125 first tried a camera-origin bullet** (bullet == camera ray) — fixed parallax but moved the muzzle off the gun. **v0.2.126 (current, per user request) restores the gun-barrel origin:** `player.js shoot()` casts the camera/crosshair ray to find the aimed point (first hit, or `CONVERGE_DIST` 80 m fallback), spawns the bullet at the BARREL (`getGunBarrelWorld`), and fires it **barrel → crosshair point** via the pure `engine/combat/aim.js` (`crosshairPoint`/`aimDirection`). The projectile passes through exactly what the reticle classified, so a previewed headshot lands as a headshot — convergence is at the ACTUAL aimed point at any range. No damage value changed; classifier untouched (body registration not loosened). Covered by `tests/aim.test.js`. **Still open:** finite travel time (60 m/s) means a fast-strafing bot can still leave a small head sphere at range before the projectile arrives — the reticle (instantaneous) over-promises on MOVING targets. Future options: increase `BULLET_SPEED`, add target-lead, a thin at-range hit-assist radius for bots, or make the reticle predict the projectile. Use `ToriiDebug.combat.lastShot` (`reason: 'moved-or-offset'` / `head-to-body`) to confirm before picking. Do NOT blindly loosen head/body thresholds. |

## Next — SDK Layer 1: Core Engine Boundaries

| # | Codebase | Category | Task |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| A1-next | TQ/NA | ARCH | **Extract player boundary — IN PROGRESS (v0.2.114 + v0.2.123 slices done).** `src/engine/entities/player.js` now owns the pure player geometry (`EYE`, `BODY_FROM_EYE`), spawn shape (`SPAWN_X/Y/Z`, `SPAWN_YAW`, `PLAYER_SAFE_CORNER`), allocation-free look-down POV math (`lookDownEyeY`/`lookDownEyeZ`), and (v0.2.123) the movement heading basis (`forwardX`/`forwardZ`/`rightX`/`rightZ(yaw)` — pure scalars the movement tick writes into its scratch vectors); the module's import was narrowed to the pure `engine/physics/bodies.js` leaf so it stays free of the Three/Rapier chain. `src/player.js` consumes them and re-exports `PLAYER_SAFE_CORNER`. Covered by `tests/player-boundary.test.js`. **Remaining:** lift the stateful movement/kinematic tick, combat (shoot/reload/recoil), lifecycle (damage/death/respawn) and body-state (`setPlayerBody`/`getPlayerCollider`/`spawnPlayerBody`) behind the boundary, then add WASD+dash, zoom, iFrames, spectator shape. Next pure slices: play-area clamp + reload/respawn timing math. Nostr Arena absorbs the old v0.6 player extraction intent without old version clutter. |
| 8 | TQ/NA | ARCH | **State machine — IN PROGRESS (v0.2.115, first slice done).** `src/state.js` now defines the explicit FSM: `GAME_EVENT`, a frozen `TRANSITIONS` table mirroring the prior phase guards exactly, `transition()`/`canTransition()`/`nextPhase()`, and predicates (`isTitle/isPlaying/isPaused/isDead/isGameover/isLive`). All 6 call sites (main, player, input, bots, targetReticle, hud) read via predicates and write via `transition()`; regression check 7 guards against direct `state.phase =` writes outside `state.js`. **Remaining:** fold secondary booleans (`reloading`, `pointerLocked`) into guarded state, wire a real `GAMEOVER` edge if/when an end-of-run screen lands, and keep the old A2 circular-dependency/ecash-wallet warning in scope. (Transition-table unit tests landed v0.2.120 — `tests/state.test.js`.) |
| 9 | TQ/NA | ARCH | **Event bus / decoupling — IN PROGRESS (v0.2.118, foliage globals migrated).** `src/events.js` is the live decoupling backbone (`EV` registry + `on/off/emit`, imports nothing → no cycles). v0.2.116 documented the registry convention, wired `EV.PHASE_CHANGE` (`{from,to,event}`) from `state.transition()`, and added regression check 8. v0.2.117 migrated the bot-hit bridge: weapons.js emits `EV.BOT_HIT_BY_PLAYER` (`{bot,dmg}`), main.js subscribes; `window._onBotHit` is now a deprecated forwarding alias and check 9 forbids internal calls. v0.2.118 moved the foliage shader materials off `window` into a module-scope registry in `arena-foliage.js` (`tickFoliage(dt)` ticks uTime per-frame allocation-free; `getGrassMat`/`getFlowerMat` accessors injected into ToriiDebug). v0.2.119 moved the mirror Reflector handle off `window` into a `mirror.js` `getMirror()` accessor (injected into ToriiDebug). `window._grassMat`/`_flowerMat`/`_mirrorMesh` remain only as deprecated debug aliases and check 10 forbids internal reads. **No functional `window.*` globals remain as internal wiring.** v0.2.121 added the first real `PHASE_CHANGE` subscriber: main.js drives top-level screen visibility (title/HUD/pause modal) from a pure `engine/ui/phaseScreens.js` map, replacing the imperative `classList` toggles scattered across the ENTER/PAUSE/RESUME/HOME call sites (behaviour-preserving; covered by `tests/phaseScreens.test.js`). **Remaining:** add further `PHASE_CHANGE` reactions (audio/presence), and emit `WS_*` once netcode lands. Required before Nostr, wallet, multiplayer, and NAP features scale. |
| B2-TQ | TQ | SDK | **Extract BotAgent interface — IN PROGRESS (v0.2.122, first slice done).** `src/engine/entities/bot-agent.js` now holds the pure decision math: `BOT_ACTION` constants (move/shoot/idle/interact/speak), scalar helpers `engageSpeed`/`steerComponent`/`inEngageRange`/`wantsToShoot`, and a `decideActions(worldState) -> BotAction[]` facade in the `BotAgent.tick` shape. `bots.js`'s `tickBots()` consumes the allocation-free scalar helpers (LOS short-circuit preserved: cheap `inEngageRange()` still gates the expensive `hasLineOfSight()`); `decideActions` is unit-tested but unwired (allocates per call). Covered by `tests/bot-agent.test.js`. **Remaining:** migrate the stateful runtime (movement tick, shoot/cooldown, blowback/death/respawn, world-state shaping) behind the boundary; wire `decideActions` once it can run off the hot path. |
| 14 | TQ/NA | TESTING | **Start Vitest unit suite — IN PROGRESS (v0.2.120, first slice done).** Vitest added (node env, `npm test`; config in `vite.config.js`). Pure seams covered: state machine (`tests/state.test.js` — legal/illegal transitions, guards, predicates), event bus (`tests/events.test.js` — on/emit/off, no-subscriber no-op, ordering, fan-out), the headshot classifier (`tests/classifier.test.js` — head-vs-body geometry), extracted to a pure `src/engine/combat/classifier.js` so it tests without Three/Rapier/browser, the phase→screen-visibility map + PHASE_CHANGE subscriber integration (`tests/phaseScreens.test.js`, v0.2.121), the BotAgent decision helpers + `decideActions` facade (`tests/bot-agent.test.js`, v0.2.122), the player heading basis + look-down POV math (`tests/player-boundary.test.js`, v0.2.123), the shot-diagnostics aim-vs-outcome miss classifier (`tests/shot-diagnostics.test.js`, v0.2.124), the combat damage/kill contract (`tests/combat-damage.test.js`, v0.2.125 — head/body damage + kill threshold vs `BOT_HP`), the barrel→crosshair aiming helper (`tests/aim.test.js`, v0.2.126 — `crosshairPoint`/`aimDirection`/convergence + barrel-fired bullet passes through the aimed point), and the reload viewmodel pose curve (`tests/reload-pose.test.js`, v0.2.127 — `reloadDip` "click down, clack snap back": drop/hold/snap-back/settle phases, rest at p=0 and p=1, overshoot bounds), and (v0.2.128) +7 head-zone realignment cases in `tests/classifier.test.js` (face shot scores; crown ~1.70 still in; above-crown 1.85/1.95 NOT head; torso stays body; lateral shoulder not promoted; outright head-collider resolve still wins), and (v0.2.129) the muzzle side convention in `tests/muzzle.test.js` (barrel +right offset is intentional; `barrelWorldFromCamera` keeps the origin on the camera WORLD-right across yaws — the local-vs-world quaternion regression). 126 tests / 11 files. Regression check [11] guards the scaffold; `npm run check` stays separate from `npm test`. **Remaining:** physics raycast/bodies (inject a mock world), FSM `GAMEOVER` edge if it lands, and later kind:0 profile fetch. |
| CI-1 | TQ/NA | TESTING | **Fold bot health into checks** — do not keep a separate daily bot-health task. Cover boot, bot count, no JS exceptions, version marker, debug namespace, and critical markers in CI/smoke checks. |

---

## Next — SDK Layer 2: Identity, NAP Zones, and Handoff

| # | Codebase | Category | Task |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| 20 | TQ | NOSTR | **kind:0 profile sync manager** — `identity/profile.js`, fetch from primary relay on login, broadcast to all relays, use latest profile picture as player avatar, handle relay sync latency. |
| NAP-formalise | TQ | ARCH | **Formalise NAP zone module** — promote the NAP metadata skeleton into a working boundary: NIP-style metadata, pure builders, validators, decoration hooks. |
| HANDOFF | TQ | ARCH | **World handoff demo** — promote handoff skeleton to a local same-browser NAP-to-NAP demo before networked/node-to-node transport. |
| PRESENCE | TQ | NOSTR | **Presence/discovery prototype** — discover online zones and players via relay-friendly metadata without central platform accounts. |
| DECOR-1 | TQ | NAP ZONE | **Player-decorated NAP zone foundation** — define wallpaper/poster/object placement manifest before building the full editor. JPEG/PNG wallpaper upload comes after the module boundary is stable. |

---

## Later — Fun Features on Solid Ground

| # | Codebase | Category | Task |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| W1 | TQ | UI/UX | **Gate Modal** — Torii Gate social popup with following/follower avatars, online rings, open events, and JOIN buttons. Depends on presence/identity. |
| CF1 | TQ/NA | GAMEPLAY | **Combat feedback checklist** — screen-shake, weapon kick, hit-markers, damage vignette, bot hit flash. Keep dt-driven, no new unapproved timers. |
| R2 | TQ/NA | WEAPON | **Immersive reload mechanic** — mag-eject geometry and hip-fire lock during reload. Do after weapons boundary is cleaner. |
| LB1 | TQ/NA | NOSTR | **Persistent leaderboard** — kind:30000 read/write, top 10, title screen rank, relay-native identity. Depends on identity boundary. |
| 21 | TQ/NA | HUD | **2D mini-map** — live player and bot positions. |
| V1 | TQ/NA | GAMEPLAY | **Contrail plane** — low-poly flyby, permanent contrail, shootable hitbox, falling reward crate. |
| G1 | TQ/NA | ASSET | **gun.glb** — proper compact sidearm model, compressed textures, swap into viewmodel/world gun, add to precache if applicable. |
| B1 | NA | GAMEPLAY | **Kill feed + death counter** — Nostr Arena-specific unless pulled into Torii Quest later. |
| B2-NA | NA | GAMEPLAY | **Bot visual behaviour polish** — patrol/chase animation polish and obstacle avoidance for Nostr Arena. Separate from Torii Quest BotAgent SDK work. |
| NPC-PERSONAL | TQ | NPC/AI | **Personal NPCs (future).** Spawn personal/companion NPCs built from a player's own GLB avatar, later driven by an AI "brain" (e.g. customer-service / concierge persona in a NAP zone). Builds on the NAP Chiefmonkey NPC skeleton + the BotAgent boundary; defer until the player-GLB pipeline and BotAgent runtime are stable. Chiefmonkey spelling: capital C, lowercase m, one word. |

## Later — Economy, Markets, and Infrastructure

| # | Codebase | Category | Task |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| 19 | TQ | ECASH | **NIP-60 eCash wallet** — NIP-07 auth, live sat balance, arena stakes, signed eCash transfers. Do after identity/world foundations. |
| 6 | TQ | NAP ZONE | **Live Nostr auctions** — kind:30402/16, NIP-17 order flow, auction podium, Lightning/eCash payment. |
| 7 | TQ | NAP ZONE | **Host-configurable shop stalls** — stalls manifest, Nostr listing metadata, stall geometry per vendor. |
| 3 | TQ | NAP ZONE | **NAP Zone video chat** — private WebRTC, encrypted signalling, self-hostable STUN/TURN path. |
| 4a | TQ | INFRA | **Self-hosted coturn TURN server** — each arena host can run their own TURN server. |
| 4b | TQ | INFRA | **Nostr relay as ICE candidate** — track/propose relay/wss extension ideas. |
| 12 | TQ/NA | PERFORMANCE | **WebGPU renderer** — Three.js WebGPU backend behind feature flag. |
| 13 | TQ/NA | BUNDLE | **Bundle treemap audit** — rollup visualizer, unused Three.js extras, asset-size review. |
| 22 | TQ/NA | INFRA | **GitHub weekday scan** — optional scheduled scan of open issues/PRs when the project has enough contributor activity to justify it. |

---

## Open / Parked

| # | Category | Task |
|---|----------|------|
| NIP46-1 | BUG | **Primal remote signer — pubkey not returned** — external blocker. Keep visible; real fix requires Primal NIP-46 compliance. |
| TP1 ⏸ | GAMEPLAY | **Touchpad / laptop controls — PARKED** — revisit after core gameplay and pointer-lock controls are stable. |

---

## Removed / Archived

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| A2 | **Removed as standalone.** Merged into state machine, event bus, and BotAgent extraction notes. |
| B3 | **Removed.** Redundant with ToriiDebug, smoke tests, and CI. If needed, it belongs inside CI, not as a separate scheduled task. |
| Old v0.6 migration tables | **Archived.** Useful history, but not active Torii Quest execution guidance. Recover from Git/session history if needed. |
| Completed v0.2.100–v0.2.113 repair items | **Archived.** Keep reports and strategy history, but do not leave completed/debugged work in the active TODO. |

---

## Critical Rules

- **Version bump on EVERY deploy** — `v0.2.xxx-alpha`, max 999.
- **godMode = false** — NEVER deploy true.
- **No new `setTimeout`** except existing allowed cases: nostr.js WebSocket close and hud.js kill-feed.
- **No new `Vector3` / `Matrix4` in hot paths** — reuse scratch objects.
- **Comments use “nostrich” not “ostrich”.**
- **Chiefmonkey** — capital C, lowercase m, one word.
- **Debug tools ship unconditionally** in alpha.
- **ESC = instant pause**, overriding everything.
- **Panel-locked cursor click NEVER fires weapon.**
- **Bullets originate at the gun BARREL and are aimed THROUGH the crosshair** (barrel → crosshair target point on the camera ray; pure `engine/combat/aim.js`). Updated v0.2.126 — supersedes the old "bullets fire from CAMERA position" rule (the v0.2.125 camera-origin experiment is retired). The projectile must still pass through the exact point the reticle previews so a headshot preview lands as a headshot.
- **Use source, not patched dist**, except emergency hotfixes.
- **Deploy preview + publish live every version** when shipping to `torii-quest.pplx.app`.
- **No GitHub push every micro-version unless asked**; current instruction allows pushing completed v0.2.113/docs.
- **Prefer FOSS/open protocols**; do not recommend Google, Cloudflare, Microsoft, or Babylon.js.
